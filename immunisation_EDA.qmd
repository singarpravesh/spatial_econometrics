Lets first read the data that I have sent you.
```{r}
read.csv('immunization_data.csv') -> im_data 
```

So lets look at the structure of the data
```{r}
str(im_data)
```

Load the required packages.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rdhs)
library(haven)
```


## Average education level across states

```{r}
im_data %>% 
  group_by(v101.x) %>% 
  summarise(avg_edu = mean(v133)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(v101.x, avg_edu), y = avg_edu)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "States",
       y = "Mean Years of Schooling",
       title = "Average Education Across States in India",
       caption = "The numbers are the state codes in DHS 7 (2019-21)")
