## Datum
- The concept of absolute space and time indicates that there exists a fixed reference frame against which the positions and motions of objects can be measured.
- The idea of a fixed datum is crutial to this concept of absolute space and time.
- This provides a reference point from which the absolute positions and times of objects can be measured, in a manner analogous to how zero serves the natural origin for amounts (positive and negative).
- For space, a datum involves more than one dimension.
- The combination of datum and a measurement unit (scale) is a *reference system*.

## Simple feature geometries
- They are a way to describe the geometries of *features*.
  - Features have a geometry, time properties, and attributes (that could include labels that describe the feature and/or have values that quantitatively measure it).
- The seven most common simple features geometries are:    
  - `POINT` - a single point geometry
  - `MULTIPOINT` - set of points
  - `LINESTRING` - two or more points connected by lines.
  - `MULTILINESTRING` - set of linestrings
  - `POLYGON` - exterior ring with zero or more inner rings, denoting holes
  - `MULTIPOLYGON` - set of polygons
  - `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` - set of  the geometries above.

## Reading data

```{r}
library(sf)

# Let's read a file in the `sf` package
(st_read(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package = "sf")) -> nc)
```

- Here `.gpkg` is a *geopackage* file.
- This file has only one *layer*.

```{r}
st_layers(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package = "sf"))
```


## Writing data

```{r}

```
